Lynch_csci2270_Finalproject

This program builds off Assignment5. Instead of using a Binary Search Tree, Vectors are used for the main data structure type. I chose vectors becasue 1; I am familiar with them and 2; they are more possible to manipulate, in terms of sorting the order in which the vector is arranged. Re-arranging of the vector occurs frequenctly in this program.

Most descripitve comments are throughout the cpp file, with some in the main driver as well. Also in the main driver are instruction on how to compile and run the program in the terminal.
